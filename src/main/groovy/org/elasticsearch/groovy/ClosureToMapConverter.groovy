/**
 * {@code ClosureToMapConverter} serves as a utility to convert {@link Closure}s into {@link Map}s with {@link String}
 * keys and {@link Object} values. The values can be {@link List}s, {@link Map}s, or other values (normal objects). In
 * general, this serves as a convenient way to load JSON-like syntax in Groovy and convert it into a format usable by
 * Elasticsearch.
 * <pre>
 * Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = mapClosure {
 *   name {
 *     first = "Example"
 *     middle = ["First", "Second"]
 *     last = "Name"
 *   }
 *   details {
 *     nested {
 *       user_id = 1234
 *       timestamp = new Date()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This class is added to {@link Closure}s automatically via the {@link ClosureExtensions} class, so the above code can
 * be slightly simplified by avoiding the static import of {@link ClosureToMapConverter#mapClosure} and instead using
 * the {@link ClosureExtensions#asMap(Closure)} extension method.
 * <pre>
 * Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = {
 *   name {
 *     first = "Example"
 *     middle = ["First", "Second"]
 *     last = "Name"
 *   }
 *   details {
 *     nested {
 *       user_id = 1234
 *       timestamp = new Date()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }.asMap()
 * </pre>
 * It's important to note that the field name's can be specified as methods <em>or</em> properties. This means that
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   name {
 *     first "Example"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * is treated the same way as
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   name = {
 *     first = "Example"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Mixing the two styles is allowed, but consistency is naturally very important for code readability.
 * <p>
 * Instances should never be reused. Instances of this class are not thread safe, but separate instances do not share
 * any state and therefore multiple instances can run in parallel.

     * value is sought. In general, that only occurs on the <em>right hand side</em> (e.g., x = y, where y is the right
     * hand side). However, if the value is unrecognized, then it's either an error <em>or</em>, more likely, it's being
     * used in the form of "x.y.z = a" rather than "x { y { z = a } }". Doing this should is considered an error.

     * Perhaps unexpectedly, this will <em>never</em> return property values unless given the full name. When Groovy
     * is unraveling the shorthand version, this method is called twice in the above example. Once with "x", again with
     * "y", and finally the setter is called against "y" for "z". By tracking "x" and "y", we can appropriately create
     * the "x.y.z" key that is intended. Because we are building it, we don't want to return any value that we happen
